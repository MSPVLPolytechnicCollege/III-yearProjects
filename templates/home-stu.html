                <p>Alumni Management is the process of maintaining a strong, ongoing relationship between an institution and its former students. It involves fostering engagement through events like reunions, networking opportunities, and mentorship programs. Effective alumni management helps build a vibrant community where alumni can contribute to the growth of their alma mater, whether through donations, expertise, or volunteer efforts. Leveraging tools such as CRM systems, social media, and dedicated alumni portals, institutions can keep alumni informed, connected, and inspired to stay involved. This continuous connection not only strengthens institutional pride but also opens avenues for mutual growth and collaboration.
